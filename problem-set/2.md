## Exercise 1.

Consider the family of intervals

$$
U_n = \left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right), \quad \text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}
$$

which one is open, however their infinite intersection is $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right)$ whose unique element is 0 - a set which is not open.

## Exercise 2.

### item a.

Defining a open ball as $B(x, \epsilon) :=$ { $y\in X : d(x, y) < \epsilon$ }, thus the set $\tau =$ { $A \subseteq X: \forall x\in A, \exists \epsilon > 0: B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq A$ }, then:

1. $\emptyset \subset \tau$ (tautological) and $X \in \tau$, since $\forall x\in X, \forall \epsilon>0: B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq X$;
2. $A = \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha \implies \forall x \in A, \exists \eta: x\in A_\eta \implies \forall x\in A, \exists \epsilon > 0: B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq A_\eta \subseteq A$;
3. $A = \bigcap_{\alpha \le n} A_\alpha \implies \forall x \in A, \exists \epsilon = min(x_1, ..., x_n) > 0: B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha \le n} A_\alpha = A$;

### item b.

Let $d(x, y) = 1$ if $x \ne y$ else $0$, then:

1. immediately $\forall x, y \in X: d(x, y) \ge 0$;
2. also, immediately, $\forall x \in X: d(x, x) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = x$;
3. since, equality relation is symmetric, $\forall x, y \in X: d(x, y) = d(y, x)$;
4. $\forall x = z \in X:$ let $z\in X: y = x \Leftrightarrow d(x,y) = d(y,z) = 0$, thus by property (1) $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$. Furthermore, $\forall x \ne z \in X:$ let $z\in X: y = x \Leftrightarrow d(x,y) = 0$ and $d(y,z) = 1$, thus, $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$;

defining a distance. The induced topology is $\tau =$ { $A \subseteq X: \forall x\in A, \exists \epsilon > 0: B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq A$ }, therefore, taking a subset $A \subseteq X$, $\forall x \in A, \exists \epsilon = 1 > 0: B(x, 1) =$ { $y\in X : d(x, y) < 1$ } $=$ { $x$ } $\subseteq A$,

thus the topology is the discrete topology.

## Exercise 3.

### item 1.a.

The set $C_x^1$ is:

* a neighborhood. $B(x, 1) \subseteq C_x^1$;
* a closed set. $X - C_x^1$ is closed, since $\forall x \notin C_x^1, \exists \epsilon = d(x, y) - 1 > 0: \forall z \in B(x, \epsilon): d(x, z) \ge d(x, y) - d(y, z) > 1 \Leftrightarrow z \notin C_x^1 \Leftrightarrow B(y, \epsilon) \subseteq X - C_x^1$;

### item 1.b.

The set $N_x^\epsilon$ is a neighborhood, since $N_x^\epsilon = B(x, \epsilon)$;

### item 1.c.

The interior of $N_x^\epsilon$ is itself, since $\forall y\in N_x^\epsilon,\exists A = B(x, \epsilon) open: A\subseteq N_x^\epsilon$.

### item 1.d.

The closure of $N_x^\epsilon$ is its closed ball, { $y \in X: d(x, y) \le \epsilon$ }.

### item 1.e.

The boundary of $N_x^\epsilon$ is given by $Cl(N_x^\epsilon) - Int(N_x^\epsilon) =$ { $y \in X: d(x, y) = \epsilon$ }.

### item 2.a.

If $A$ is open, $A$ itself is a neighborhood of $x$, furthermore, for every $x \in A$, there is a neighborhood $N_x$ of $x$ contained in $A$, thus taking $\bigcup_{x \in A} N_x$ it will be exactly $A$ and by the axioms of topological space it will be open.

### item 2.b.

If $A$ is closed, $X - A$ is open and then is itself a neighborhood of any element of the set which doesn't intersect $A$, in addition, if every $x \in X-A$ has a neighborhood $N_x$ which doesn't intersect $A$, $X - A = \bigcup_{x \in X - A} N_x \in \tau$, thus $X - A$ is open so $A$ is closed.

### item 3.a.

If $x \in Int(A)$, exists a open subset of $A$ which is by itself a neighborhood contained in $A$, besides this, If exists a neighborhood contained in $A$ for every $x$, imediately $N_x \subseteq Int(A)$.

### item 3.b.

If $x \in Cl(A)$, exists a neighborhood such that x is element, thus its intersection with $A$ is not empty, furthermore, if every neighborhood of every $x$ intersects $A$, for every neighborhood with $x$ as element the intersection is not empty, thus imediately $x \in Cl(A)$.

### item 3.c.

If $x \in \partial A$, $x \in Cl(A)$ and $x \in Cl(A^c)$, so for each neighborhood of $x$, its intersection will be non-empty both with $A$ and $A^c$.
