## Exercise 1.

Consider the family of intervals

$$
U_n = \left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right), \quad \text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}\text{,}
$$

which one is open, however their infinite intersection is $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right)$ whose unique element is 0 - a set which is not open.
